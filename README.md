# Haskell Urbit API

This library helps you talk to your Urbit from Haskell, via HTTP.

The "Urbit Airlock" API is a command-query API that lets you hook into apps
running on your Urbit. You can submit commands (called "pokes") and subscribe to
responses.

See the `test.hs` file for some example usages.
